Lab 1 

	For this lab, I first started to work on my personal resume page. I decided
what headers I wanted my file to contain, what information I wanted to 
include, and how I wanted the layout to be. Once I had come up with all of 
the ideas, I then started to work on the stylesheet, which would make 
my page look much more presentable. I used my Intro Into ITWS work as
a refrence, due to the fact that the Intro course is the only background I 
have, and being I took the class in the fall 2020 semester, I needed a 
little bit of a refresher. 
	I believe the hardest thing for me this lab 
was figuring out the Microformats piece, and how to also navigate Github.
I had never heard of Microformats before, so that required a little bit of 
research in order to figure out what the purpose of Microformats are, 
and where I needed to add them. Upon reading about this topic, I discovered 
that Microformats are used to make the information in your individual HTML
code more recongizable to different types of computers, and I added the
Microformats to my personal information on my resume page. Additionally, I
am not too familiar with Github, so I found it a little challenging to 
try and figure out how to upload documents, and commit changes to the 
repository. However, with the help of my group members, I was able to 
figure out how to successfully upload my work, and I now have a much better
understanding of how Github functions.
