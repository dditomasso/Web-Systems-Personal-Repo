For this problem I created a seperate fucntion for eahc AJAX call by using the 
id of the currency that I had wanted to convert. Unfornatalty, I struggled to get 
the onclick event working for my buttons, so nothing occurs when a button is 
clicked. Additonally, becuase I could not get the AJAX workig properly, I focused
most of my time on this quiz trying to obtain functionality: therefore,
I ran out of time in order to add creativity to my application in 
reguards to CSS and HTML.
