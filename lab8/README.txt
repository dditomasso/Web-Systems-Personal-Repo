README Lab 8

For this lab, I first started with the JSON file. I got stuck on how to 
correctly set up arrays in JSON initally, however after asking for help 
from professor Callahan, I was eventually able to get everyting working.
There are multipule objects wihtin the Lectures and Labs objects, which 
holds the data for the class.

Next, I decided to work on the home page. I created a Nav bar at the 
top of the page that holds the index info, Login, and logout buttons. 
Within the index page I have php that outputs the JSON information onto
the screen. This is the part where I got stuck, and couldn't figure out. 
Even after doing a lot of research, I could not figure out how to 
chnage the output of the PHP into CSS containers, in order to create 
a dynamic list as the lab entails. However, I did add a button at the end 
that completly refreshes the page, and therefore also refreses the JSON 
calls and the PHP code along with it. 

For the thrid part of this lab I used the login and logout pages that 
we used in class. I also created a database that has a singular table,
containing id, uname, and pass. I then inserted 2 users within the table to 
start. 

Overall, I was unfortanlty unable to finish this lab due to the fact I 
could not figure out how to get the dynamic list of the JSON info working.
I tried my best with the PHP output program, which does output all of the 
infromatin required onto the index page for each lecture and lab.
