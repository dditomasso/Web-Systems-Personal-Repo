Lab 2 README

(NOTE: Our group divided up work, and my portion was to Annotate Articles 1 and 2,
and to help contribute to the CSS file)

For this lab, I first started writing the proper HTML tags and headers for 
the full, un annotated versions of Article 1 and Article 2. From there,
I completed a summary and annotation of the text, using those same tags and 
headers. Then, I created the basic CSS and backgound imaging for the sheets,
and created the text imaging, aligment, and the bold text options for headers 
h1 and h2. Once I did this, I had to incorporate the JS my group prepare with 
my article, and I added youtube videos for articles one and two as an extra
annotation addition. 

After this was completed, I then had to figure out how create a branch in Github,
instead of committing directly to main. After this was completed, I then created
a pull request, which merges the work to the main branch, which was something
I learned during this lab. With the help of Dr. Callahan through discord, I 
then included my group project partners for a peer review of my work, which after,
that was completed, ten offically added my work to the main branch. 

One thing I definetly struggled with in this lab however, was the utilization of 
google fonts. I know most are aware of how to use google fonts in my class, however
it is something i have always struggled to implement, and this lab was know different. 
Ulitmatley I couldnt get the google font to appear, however I left my code
in my two dcuements so I can look back and try and figure out what I did wrong.
Additonally, I also plan on attending office hours next week in order to figure 
out exactly why my google font implementation wasn't successful, and how to better 
improve my CSS pages.
