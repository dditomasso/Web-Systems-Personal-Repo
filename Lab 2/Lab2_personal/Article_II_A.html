        <h1>Article II Annotation</h1>
        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <p>
         The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. 
         The President and Vice President will be elected in office for a total of four years, until 
         the next election will take place. 
        </p>
        <p>
         The electors will meet in their respective states, and a ballot will be held in each 
         individual state as a vote for President. If the majority of individuals in a certian state
         vote for a single person, then all of the states votes will go to said individual. 
         The runner with with the most votes from all states will become the next president of the United 
         States, and by default, the person with the greatest number of votes of the 
         electors shall be the Vice President.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the case of removal of the President from Office, or of his death, resignation, or 
         inability to complete the powers and duties required, the duties of President will
         fall onto the current Vice President of the United states.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before entering office, and offically becoming the president of the United States, the 
         individual must say the following words:
         "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the 
         United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution
         of the United States."
        </p>
        <p>
         Section 1 of this article talks greatly about the process of how an inidvidual 
         becomes the President of the United states. It ensures that the president must be mentally and 
         physically capable of carring out their duties, and establishes plans in case the president is 
         unable to do so, for some reaosn. Additonally, this seciton talks about the election process,
         and how the voting system of the states functions: where individuals vote in each state, and 
         whichever candidate gets the most votes in said state, then all of the states votes (a number that
         is pre-set based on population and other factors), goes to said canidiate. This ensures an equal 
         and fair voting process for the canidiates, states, and citizens alike. 
        </p>

        <h2>Section 2</h2>
        <p>
         The President is the Commander in Chief: meaning, he holds the power of the Army,
         Navy, the Militia of the several States, if needed to be called into action for a given reason.
         However, he holds this power, the power to make treaties, and the power to appoint Judges of the 
         supreme court, only with te advice and consent of the Senate. 
        </p>
        <p>
         This seciton of Article II declatres some of the power the president holds, however,
         also establishes the limitations of this power (needing consent from the senate). This is crucial,
         becuase it ensures that the President dosen't hold too much power for themsleves, and futher 
         implements the system of checks and balances within the Goverment. 
        </p>

        <h2>Section 3</h2>
        <p>
         This section declares that the President has a responsibility to uphold of reguraly 
         informing the Senate and other branches of goverment the status of certian issues and / or 
         events.
        </p>
        <p>
         This ensures that there is a form of cohesive and smooth communication between
         the different branches of Goverment, which is esential in order for theGoverment to funciton 
         to it's full capability.
