    parts of Congress.

    goverment, states, and citizens. Having both the House of Represenatatives and the Senate guarntee 
    this equal distribution of power amongst the three groups, such that one group does not have an 
    avantage over the other (checks and balances).
  </p>

  <p>
    This section declares that members of the House of Representatives will be 
    elected into office by individuals from every state. To run for the House of Representatives, 
    you must be 25 years or older, and must be a Citizen of the United States for at least 7 years.

    House of Representatives. If the population of a state is low, then under this article they are 
    guarnteed at least one representative, and contraversliy, if the population of the state is high,
    then they are capped a certian number of representatives, to ensure that the larger states do not

    each State, reguardless of population. Elections occur every two years, and Senators must be

    of the United States will be President of the Senate, but will have no vote on matters, 
    unless the vote is equally divided. The Senate also holds the power to try the President of the 
    United States for Impeachment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Esssentially, the Senate allows states a fixed number of senators (2), reguardless 
    of population. This means, this gives smaller states more of an opportuinity to voice their 
    votes equally, whereas in the House of Representatives, larger states may have more of a say
    due to their large population size.

    puts all of their focus and attention onto the job they were elected for, which allows the citizens 
    voices to be heard wihtin the Goverment.

    raise and support armies, to maintain a Navy, and create rules and regukations for the
    military forces.

  <p>
    If the President of the United States had the sole power to declare war, raise an army,
    and be in control of the Navy, too much power would fall into the hands of a single individual. Therefore
    it is crucial that Congress also have a say in crucial matters such this, to ensure that no rash decisions
    are made.
