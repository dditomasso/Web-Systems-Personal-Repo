      <h1>Article IV</h1>
      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <p>
        Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <p>
        The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Person charged in any State with Treason, Felony, or other Crime, who shall flee from Justice, and be found in another State, shall on Demand of the executive Authority of the State from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the State having Jurisdiction of the Crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in Consequence of any Law or Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but shall be delivered up on Claim of the Party to whom such Service or Labour may be due.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 3</h2>
      <p>
        New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or Parts of States, without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.
      </p>  
      <h2>Section 4</h2>
      <p>
        The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Section 1 states that individual states may not infringe on other states' laws, such that an illegal act in one state will not be deemed illegal in another, unless that State's Law also prohibits it. Additionally, Congres is given the power to mediate when State Law comes in conflict, for example marriage between individuals from different states, where it may be illegal in one but legal in the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 2 dictates that individuals crossing state borders in order to escape punishment for Treason, a Felony, or any other crime must be delivered to the originating state, regardless of the new state's legislation, as they commiitted a crime where it was illegal and fled. Additionally, individuals held to mandated labour cannot escape this obligation, and must be returned to the party in supervision of the labour, regardless of any state laws that may dictate otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, all Citizens across the United States are treated equally under the law, entitled to all privelliges and benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 3 allows the United States to introduce more states into the Union, however a single state may not form a smaller one within it's own bounds. Additionally, two parts of separate states cannot form into one new state without approval from their respective state legislature and Congress itself. Additionally, Article IV recognises that not all territory under the United States is an independant State, and so Congress has full power over these territories. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 4 guarantees states that they are to be run Democratically, through the voice of the people, and that Congress has the power and responsibility to protect the United States from enemies both foreign and domestic, by way of authorising legislature to assist federally in minimising riots and other forms of violence.
