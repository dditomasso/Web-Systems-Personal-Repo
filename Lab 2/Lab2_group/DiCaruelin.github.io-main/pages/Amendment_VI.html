    <h1>Sixth Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.
    </p>

			The Sixth Amendment is meant to ensure the rights of the accused. This gives them the ability to defend themselves with an appointed lawyer and informed of the specific crimes they're accused of. Speedy in this amendment can mean up to a year.
