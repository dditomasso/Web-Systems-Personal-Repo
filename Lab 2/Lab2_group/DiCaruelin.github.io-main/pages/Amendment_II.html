    <h1>Second Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free 
        State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.
    </p>

      In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court held 
      that the "Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm 
      unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally 
      lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."

      On the one hand, some believe that the Amendment's phrase "the right of the 
      people to keep and bear Arms" creates an individual constitutional right 
      for citizens of the United States. Under this "individual right theory," the 
      United States Constitution restricts legislative bodies from prohibiting 
      firearm possession, or at the very least, the Amendment renders prohibitory 
      and restrictive regulation presumptively unconstitutional. On the other hand, 
      some scholars point to the prefatory language "a well regulated Militia" to 
      argue that the Framers intended only to restrict Congress from legislating 
      away a state's right to self-defense. Scholars have come to call this theory 
      "the collective rights theory." A collective rights theory of the Second Amendment 
      asserts that citizens do not have an individual right to possess guns and 
      that local, state, and federal legislative bodies therefore possess the authority 
      to regulate firearms without implicating a constitutional right.
