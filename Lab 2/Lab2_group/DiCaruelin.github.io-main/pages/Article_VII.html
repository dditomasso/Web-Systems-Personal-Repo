      At the time of it's writing, The United States was made up of thirteen (13) independent states, who would all come together to establish The Constitution, by which America would be legislated. Article VII states that nine (9) out of the thirteen (13) states must ratify The Constitution, thereby accepting it's validity and formally agreeing to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delaware was the first state to ratify this Constitution on December 7, 1787. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Following this, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticuit, Massachussets, Maryland, and South Carolina all ratified the Constitution by May 1788
    </p>
    <p>
      The final required state to ratify the Constitution was New Hampshire, on June 21, 1788. At this time, the Constitution became legal throughout the United States, even among those who had not yet ratified it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhode Island was the final state in America to ratify the Constitution on May 29, 1790, however it was not done through a Constitutional Convention.
