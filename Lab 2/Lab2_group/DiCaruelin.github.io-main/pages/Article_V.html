    <h1>Article V</h1>
    <p class="main">
        The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.

      The Founding Fathers, upon drafting the Constitution, were aware that their current values and concerns could possibly become moot over time, or that new concerns would arise. In order to make the Constitution an immortal document, they introduced Article V, which allows a two-thirds (2/3) majority of both the House of Representatives (290/435) and the Senate (67/100) to ratify an Amendment to the constitution, to either introduce new legislation or to remove legislation no longer beneficial.

      Alternatively, a two-thirds (2/3) majority of states can call for a Constitutional Convention to ratify an amendment, at which point three-quarters (3/4) of state legislatures must ratify it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Article V states that no amendments to the Constitution may limit a state's equal representation in the Senate. Additionally, until 1808, no amemdments may prohibit the importation of slaves, nor allow any form of direct taxation other than the system of enumeration described in Article I Section 9.
