    <h1>Seventh Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.
    </p>
    <hr>
		<p>
		The Seventh Ammendment is meant to defend against corrupt or biased judges. This amendment is largely unused as only 1% of civil cases are presented to a jury.
