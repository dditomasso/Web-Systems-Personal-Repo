      <h1>Article III</h1>
      <h2>Section 1</h2>
      <p>
        The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <p>
        The Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;—between a State and Citizens of another State;—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 3</h2>
      <p>
        Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood, or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Section 1 of Article III dictates that the single Supreme Court will hold final determination on Federal Law, while the lower courts may rule certain ways as well. Additionally, members of these courts will be paid a wage which can not decrease during their time in office.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section 2 allows federal courts to determine interpretations of the Constitution, Congressioal Laws, and soverign rights and responsibilities. They are also given the power to oversee conflicts between states, a state and the federal government, and between a state and a citizen from a different state. These powers, however, are only applicable when an affected citizen brings these claims to federal court - these courts cannot dictate these interpretations or determinations independent from a heard case. Finally, all crimes other than impeachment are to be heard by a Jury, held in the state where the crime was committed, if applicable.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Section 3 specifies the crime of Treason in the United States. Treason is defined as any individual either waging war on the United States or providing aid to a foreign enemy. Either the testimony of a minimum of two witnesses to a single act, or a confession of guilt, are required for a person to be found guilty of treason. At this point, Congress determines the punishment, but they do not have the power to punish uninvolved members of their family or associates.
