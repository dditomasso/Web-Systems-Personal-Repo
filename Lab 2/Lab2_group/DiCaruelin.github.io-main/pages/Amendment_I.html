    <h1>First Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or 
        prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, 
        or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to 
        petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
    </p>

      The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, 
      assembly, and the right to petition.  It forbids Congress from both promoting 
      one religion over others and also restricting an individualâ€™s religious practices.  
      It guarantees freedom of expression by prohibiting Congress from restricting 
      the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely.  It also guarantees 
      the right of citizens to assemble peaceably and to petition their government.   
    </p>
    <p>
      The Supreme Court interprets the extent of the protection afforded to these rights. 
      The First Amendment has been interpreted by the Court as applying to the entire federal 
      government even though it is only expressly applicable to Congress. Furthermore, 
      the Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment 
      as protecting the rights in the First Amendment from interference by state governments.
