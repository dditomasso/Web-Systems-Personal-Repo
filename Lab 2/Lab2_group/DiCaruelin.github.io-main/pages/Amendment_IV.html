    <h1>Fourth Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, 
        and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be 
        violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported 
        by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be 
        searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

      The Fourth Amendment originally enforced the notion that “each man’s home 
      is his castle”, secure from unreasonable searches and seizures of property 
      by the government.  It protects against arbitrary arrests, and is the 
      basis of the law regarding search warrants, stop-and-frisk, safety inspections, 
      wiretaps, and other forms of surveillance, as well as being central to many 
      other criminal law topics and to privacy law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people’s right to privacy and 
      freedom from unreasonable intrusions by the government. However, the Fourth Amendment 
      does not guarantee protection from all searches and seizures, but only those 
      done by the government and deemed unreasonable under the law.
