        The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each 
        State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall 
        have one vote. The electors in each State shall have the qualifications 
        requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
        When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the 
        executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill 
        such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the 
        executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the 
        vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.
    </p>
    <p class="main">
        This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term 
        of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.
