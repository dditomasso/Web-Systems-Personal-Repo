    <h1>Fifth Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous 
        crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in 
        cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in 
        actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be 
        subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or 
        limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against 
        himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due 
        process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, 
        without just compensation.

      The Fifth Amendment creates a number of rights relevant to both criminal and 
      civil legal proceedings.  In criminal cases, the Fifth Amendment guarantees 
      the right to a grand jury, forbids “double jeopardy,” and protects against 
      self-incrimination.  It also requires that “due process of law” be part of 
      any proceeding that denies a citizen “life, liberty or property” and requires 
      the government to compensate citizens when it takes private property for public use.  
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Fifth Amendment originally only applied to federal courts, the U.S. 
      Supreme Court has partially incorporated the 5th amendment to the states 
      through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The right to indictment 
      by the Grand Jury has not been incorporated, while the right against double 
      jeopardy, the right against self-incrimination, and the protection against 
      arbitrary taking of private property without due compensation have all been 
      incorporated to the states.
