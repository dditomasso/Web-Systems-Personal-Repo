        fixed for the beginning of his term, or if the President elect shall have 
        failed to qualify, then the Vice President elect shall act as President 
        until a President shall have qualified; and the Congress may by law 
        provide for the case wherein neither a President elect nor a Vice President 
        elect shall have qualified, declaring who shall then act as President, or 
        the manner in which one who is to act shall be selected, and such person
