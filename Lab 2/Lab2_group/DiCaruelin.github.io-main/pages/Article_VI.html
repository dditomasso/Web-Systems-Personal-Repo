    <h1>Article VI</h1>
    <p class="main">
        All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as under the Confederation.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.

      At the time of the Constitution's writing, America's legal system was very erratic. Article VI was written to mandate which legislation was to be followed in times of conflict. As many state and federal laws deal with the same subject, the legislation clashed, leading to arguments around which statute was to be followed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Article VI states that Federal Law (the Law of the Land) is to be given precidence when in conflict with State Law, and that members of the Judicial Office (judges, senators, representatives, and others) are bound to follow the Constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Article VI also mandates that no religion is required to be practiced or sworn to in order to qualify for any public official.
