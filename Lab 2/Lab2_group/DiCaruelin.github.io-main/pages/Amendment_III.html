    <h1>Third Ammendment</h1>
    <p class="main">
        No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the 
        consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.
    </p>

      Described by some as “a preference for the Civilian over the Military,” the 
      Third Amendment forbids the forcible housing of military personnel in a 
      citizen’s home during peacetime and requires the process to be “prescribed 
      by law” in times of war.  This Amendment is not considered controversial 
      and has never been litigated before the United States Supreme Court.   
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been no Supreme Court explication of this Amendment, which was 
      obviously one guarantee indicating a preference for the civilian over the military.
