Lab 3 README

Process: 

For this lab, I first started off by planning what I wanted the layout of 
the webiste to be. I decided that having seperate HTML pages for the 
different topics (Programs, Undergrad Major, Undergrad Minor, Grad Program,
News, Faculty, and Contact) would be best, this way everything could be 
neat, organized, and easy to access. From there, I began to transfer 
the infromation form the website (text and images) into each of their
respective pages, using HTML tagging. I utilized the <p>, <li>, <div class>
<ul id>, <h> tags, and many more throughout my website, this way the process 
of creating my CSS file would be easier. After this was completed, I then 
began to work on the menu for my website. I wanted a menu that was 
consistent and easy to access for all of the pages, this way the user would
have easy access and naviagtion of the site. I decided that also blocking
the menu options with two solid black lines would make the menu bar easier
to find. I then included all of the page names, which were linked to their
respective HTML pages. 

From there, I then decided to work on the footer of my website. I eventually
came to the conclusion that the best thing to put in the footer of the 
website was a link to all of the social medias ITWS has to offer. This makes
it easy for the user to find, and allows the user to explore the ITWS 
program at RPI, after they have read all of the information on the website.
After a bit of research, I managed to figure out how to make the footer
"stick" to the bottom of the page, since in the beginning the footer
would float up to wherever the body text ended on the page.

Once this was completed and transferred to every page, I then decided to 
work on the CSS of the website. I started off by setting up 
the font family and text size for the body text, and then moved onto
all the different header tags. Each header tag has the font set to bold, and
as the heading numbers increase, the size of the text decreases, which gives 
orginzation to the content on each page. From there, I then created 
a buch of different classes and id's for each specific page, this way
I could change certian features. An example of this would text alignment, 
in which I can change the alignment for one page without doing it for the 
enitrety of the website. Additonally, I also created a class specific to any 
lists, in which padding was added in order to indent the bullet point more so 
then the body text, which looks more professional. 

Creativity:

For this lab, I included a few CSS features to give the user an overall 
smoother and better expirence. One of these features was "fixing" the 
bacground image into place. Before having added this feature, the 
background picture would move with the text when scrolling 
in the window. If the window was too large for the photo
(which it was for some pages with more text) the image 
would get cut off and repeat, which would create a line 
that cut thorugh the image. In order to fix this, I used 
"background-repeat" and set it to "no repeat","background-attachment" and 
set it to "fixed", and "background-size" and set it to "cover."

Another feature I utlilized for creativity was "flex." Flex came in 
handy often, when it came to placing objects evenly on the window screen. 
For example, on the "Programs" page, I included 3 photos that can be 
found on the current RPI ITWS website. However, they appeared vertically
without any addition of CSS. In order to fix this problem, i created two 
classes called row and column, and then set the flex value to a thrid of the 
screen (33.3%), and added a padding of 5px. This allowed the photos to appear
horizontally on the page. 

Laslty, for the "Contact Us" page, I decided to create an H-card for the ITWS
address, and a form for the user to submit any questions they may have. 
However, The H-Card and the Submission form once again appeared vertically 
and not horizontally. to fix this, I used "flex" again and created a class 
called container. This class allowed me to align the items within the 
containers, add padding, and justify the items to whatever side of the 
screen I wanted. Overall, this made the page look much more seamless and 
profesisonal.
