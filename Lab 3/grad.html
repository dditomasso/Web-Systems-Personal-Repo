    <h3>Ph.D in Multidisciplinary Science</h3>  
    <p>
        Ph.D. programs in Architecture, Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences, Management,
        and Science offer a wealth of opportunities for doctoral study with focused IT research.
        In addition, for highly interdisciplinary research, an IT Track is available in 
        the Multidisciplinary Science Ph.D. program. The IT Track is designed to allow a student to 
        work with faculty from multiple Rensselaer departments and schools.
    </p>
    <h4>Information Technology Track</h4>
    <p>
        The IT Track in the Multidisciplinary Science PhD program is designed to prepare students 
        for a career in interdisciplinary IT research. The IT Track requires a technical core coupled 
        with a concentration that provides the context for the student's research. This concentration 
        may incorporate one or more disciplines in addition to its core IT components. The IT Track 
        focuses on research – creative and original enough to be recognized by scholars in the student's 
        areas of concentration, both in academia and industry.
    </p>
    <h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>
        To successfully complete the IT Track of the Multidisciplinary Science PhD program and earn 
        a PhD in Multidisciplinary Science, the student must satisfy the following four requirements:
        Doctoral Qualifying Exam Doctoral Concentration Doctoral Candidacy Exam Thesis Defense 
        Examination In addition, a student must satisfy all the Institute requirements for a PhD as 
        defined in the Rensselaer Catalog. A student should satisfy these four requirements in the order 
        that they appear above. As a general guideline, the Doctoral Qualifying Exam should be completed 
        following the first year of study, the Doctoral Concentration after the second year of study, and 
        the Doctoral Candidacy Exam after the third year of study.
    </p>
    <h4>DOCTORAL QUALIFYING EXAMINATION (DQE)</h4>
    <p>
        The Doctoral Qualifying Examination (DQE) is intended to determine if a student has sufficient
        knowledge and ability in the core principles of IT to be formally admitted into the doctoral
        program. It is designed to test the student's fundamental knowledge in computing and other core
        areas of IT. The exam consists of four parts, each of which is an oral examination. Part 1 - IT 
        Theory Part 2 - Technologies Part 3 - Contributing Core IT Disciplines Part 4 – Research Area
    </p>
    <h4>DOCTORAL CONCENTRATION (DC)</h4>
    <p>
        The Doctoral Concentration (DC) assures that the student has a sufficient level of 
        competency in his or her selected concentration area to pursue advanced research in that area. 
        The DC requires that a student take a minimum of five courses pertaining to the selected 
        research concentration. The specific courses are selected with advisement from the research 
        advisor. Example research concentrations include (but are not limited to): Computer 
        Communications and Networks Electronic Commerce Discrete Event Simulation Data Mining and 
        Knowledge Discovery Computational Science and Engineering Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive 
        Science Social, Economic and Policy Studies in IT and Emerging Legal Regimes Arts, Education and
        Cultural Studies Cross-National Studies of IT Use Electronic Arts Communication in 
        Technologically Mediated Contexts Human-Computer Interaction and Interface Design Modeling, 
        Visualization and Uncertainty
    </p>
    <h4>DOCTORAL CANDIDACY EXAMINATION (DCE)</h4>
    <p>
        The purpose of the DCE is to determine whether the student has made satisfactory 
        progress in his/her doctoral program, including progress in the chosen research area, 
        and whether he/she demonstrates the ability to pursue doctoral research with distinction.
    </p>
