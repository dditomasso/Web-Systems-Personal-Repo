    <h2>Expert in Ecological Applications of AI Joins Newly Announced Imageomics Institute</h2>
    <img src="news1.JPG" alt="News1" width="350" height="175">
    <p>
        Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute computer scientist Chuck Stewart will join a newly created 
        institute aimed at using images of living organisms to understand biological processes like 
        species evolution, genetic inheritance patterns, and even behavior. Stewart, an expert in the 
        ecological applications of artificial intelligence and computer vision, will join the new 
        Imageomics Institute, which is supported by a $15 million grant from the National Science 
        Foundation (NSF).
    </p>
    <p>
        “One of the grand challenges in research is discovering the rules of life,” said Stewart, 
        a professor and head of the department of computer science at Rensselaer. “The goal of 
        imageomics is to use AI and machine learning to help infer phylogenetic traits from images 
        to understand everything from the structure of species down to individual characteristics and 
        behaviors. At its core, we will use images to make biological predictions which can be verified 
        by biologists or ecologists.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Stewart is an expert in the ecological applications of computer vision and a co-investigator 
        in the Wildbook project with Wild Me, which builds open source software and artificial 
        intelligence for the conservation research community. The project draws heavily on a computer 
        program he and his students created, known as the Image-Based Ecological Information System, 
        which can identify individual animals in ordinary photographs and match them against images of 
        known animals stored in a database.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Professor Stewart’s extensive experience in extracting detailed, individualized information 
        from wildlife imagery across multiple species makes him an essential member of the new 
        Imageomics Institute,” said Curt Breneman, dean of the School of Science at Rensselaer. 
        “His innovative computational solutions represent core enabling technology underpinning the 
        new field of imageomics.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The Imageomics Institute will be led by The Ohio State University and is an inaugural 
        institute for data-intensive discovery in science and engineering created by the NSF as 
        part of its Harnessing the Data Revolution initiative. As such, the Imageomics Institute will 
        be part of forming a national collaborative research network dedicated to computation-enabled 
        discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
        The institute will create a new field of study in which scientists use images of living 
        organisms as the basis for understanding biological processes of life on Earth. This new 
        approach, called imageomics, will utilize machine learning methodologies to extract from 
        images biological traits such as the behavior or physical appearance of an individual, or 
        even the distinguishing skeletal structure of a species. Imageomics will leverage and extend 
        the paradigm of knowledge-guided machine learning by structuring the algorithmic underpinnings 
        around biological knowledge and continually guiding and refining them using new biological 
        knowledge as it is generated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Similar to genomics before it, which applied computation to the study of the human genome, 
        imageomics will leverage computer science to help scientists extract meaning from an otherwise 
        unwieldy amount of natural image data. Images to be studied include digital collections from 
        museums, labs, and other institutions, as well as photos taken by scientists in the field, 
        camera traps, drones, and even members of the public who have uploaded their images to 
        platforms such as eBird, iNaturalist, and Wildbook.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ability to use image data for scientific discovery will get scientists closer to answering 
        compelling questions such as: Are a baby zebra’s stripes similar to its mother’s and what 
        might the genetic mechanism be for inheriting the pattern? How do the skulls of bats species 
        vary with environmental conditions and what evolutionary adaptation drives that change? What 
        subtle morphological features distinguish closely related species of fish from each other and 
        why?
    </p>
    <p>
        “So many pictures of organisms exist with scientific value that we’ve never been unable to 
        analyze at the right scale,” said Tanya Berger-Wolf, faculty director of the Translational 
        Data Analytics Institute and principal investigator for the Imageomics Institute. “This will 
        change how we are able to see and understand the natural world. Computers help humans ‘see’ 
        images differently and expose what we may otherwise miss.”
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to Berger-Wolf and Stewart, the project team includes biologist and computer 
        scientist co-investigators from Tulane University, Virginia Tech, and Duke University; senior 
        personnel from Ohio State, Virginia Tech, and six additional institutions; and collaborators 
        from more than 30 universities and organizations around the world.
    </p>
    <h2>James Hendler Named Chair of ACM Technology Policy Council</h2>
    <img src="news2.JPG" alt="News1" width="350" height="250">
    <p>
        James Hendler, the Tetherless World Professor of Computer, Web, and Cognitive Sciences at 
        Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, has been named chair of the Technology Policy Council for 
        the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
    </p>
    <p>
        As chair, Hendler will be heading the global policy council of ACM – the largest 
        professional organization for computer professionals with nearly 100,000 international 
        members dedicated to fostering the open exchange of information and promoting the highest
        professional and ethical standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The council sets the agenda for ACM’s global policy activities and serves as the central 
        convening point for the association’s interactions with government organizations, the 
        computing community, and the public in all matters of public policy related to computing and 
        information technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        “More and more, what we do as computer scientists has a profound and long-lasting impact on 
        society,” Hendler said. “Policy is often made by people who don’t understand the technology. 
        Our mission is to provide the technical background to the policy makers that will let them 
        create better policies. Guiding decisions and creating meaningful frameworks that will impact 
        society on this international scale for years to come will be a challenging and exciting 
        opportunity.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Hendler has led ACM’s United States policy committee since 2018, during which time the group 
        published numerous policy papers, most notably a statement that called for a moratorium on the 
        private and governmental use of facial recognition. The council also filed a successful amicus 
        brief at the U.S. Supreme Court in Nathan Van Buren v. United States, a case pertaining to the 
        protection of security researchers and computer networks.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the new leader of the global policy council, Hendler hopes to generate policy papers on 
        wide-ranging topics, including AI, autonomous vehicles, social media, data sharing, and privacy 
        protection. He said his goals include addressing issues in emerging economies, connecting 
        technical leaders with local policy makers around the world, and finding a way to balance the 
        conflicting rules currently in place in different countries.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Professor Hendler is one of those extraordinary individuals who empathically understands 
        the impact that technology may have on human flourishing,” said Mary Simoni, dean of the 
        School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. “Rensselaer is fortunate to have a seat at 
        the table as we navigate the incongruous concurrences of humanity and technology.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Hendler, an artificial intelligence researcher perhaps best known as one of the creators 
        of the semantic web, has authored over 350 books, technical papers, and articles. At Rensselaer, 
        he leads a number of high-profile initiatives, including the Institute for Data Exploration and 
        Applications (IDEA) and the RPI-IBM Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hendler has frequently applied his expertise to public policy. In 2010, the same year he was 
        named one of the 20 most innovative professors in America by Playboy magazine, he was selected 
        as an “Internet Web Expert” by the U.S. government to advise on the Data.gov project. In 2013, 
        he was named the Open Data Advisor to New York State and in 2015 appointed a member of the U.S. 
        Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Committee. In 2016, he became a member of the 
        National Academies Board on Research Data and Information, and in 2018, he was elected a fellow 
        of the National Academy of Public Administration. Among many other accomplishments, he also 
        previously served as the Chief Scientist of the Information Systems Office at the U.S. Defense 
        Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and was awarded a U.S. Air Force Exceptional Civilian 
        Service Medal in 2002.
    </p>
    <p>
        “I believe it is vitally important that technologists ensure our inventions can be used 
        responsibly, and in the public interest,” Hendler said. “I am excited to take on this crucial 
        role in helping to make sure that policy makers understand the implications of computing 
        research.”

    <h2>Model Sets Minimum Restrictions Needed To Control COVID-19 Given Vaccination Rate</h2>
    <img src="news3.JPG" alt="News3" width="350" height="250">
    <p>
        If only 60% of Americans were vaccinated against COVID-19, two-thirds of people currently 
        wearing face masks and half of those staying at home must stay the course to keep the disease 
        in check, according to a new model that establishes the relationship between non-pharmaceutical 
        interventions (NPI), vaccination rates, and the disease. But with a 70% vaccination rate, we 
        could eliminate all those measures with the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
        The model, available on the open access preprint website medRxiv, draws on control theory, 
        used to optimize engineered systems from washing machines to spaceships. Using publicly 
        available data tracking the disease, vaccination rates, and social distancing and hygiene 
        measures, it is able to predict the minimal non-pharmaceutical intervention needed to control 
        COVID-19 in 381 metropolitan statistical areas — cities and their surrounding communities — 
        across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Now that we have the vaccine, we’re all asking, ‘what should we do?’ Our methodology helps 
        estimate how different areas of the country, with different vaccine levels, can relax 
        non-pharmaceutical interventions while still maintaining COVID at a manageable level,” 
        said Jianxi Gao, an assistant professor of computer science at Rensselaer Polytechnic 
        Institute and co-corresponding author on the research. “We hope this approach will help 
        policy makers across the country safely relax restrictions in their area.” 
    </p>
    <p>
        By establishing the equation between the disease, vaccine, and other measures, the model 
        makes it possible to predict other aspects of the relationship. For example, the researchers 
        found that, although they collected data on eight non-pharmaceutical interventions, the model 
        could represent the dynamics of the disease with only three: face masks, staying at home, and 
        testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The model is also able to predict the duration of the diseases at different vaccination levels. 
        With overall vaccination in the U.S. currently at 45%, the model predicts the disease could be 
        eliminated in some areas within three months.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the research team said the model demonstrates the need for a cautious return to 
        pre-pandemic behavior, bolstered by high vaccination levels.
    </p>
    <p>
        “We see that we can stop the disease very fast if everyone moves quickly to get the vaccine,” 
        said Lu Zhong, a doctoral candidate in the lab of co-corresponding author Mamadou Diagne, a 
        Rensselaer assistant professor of mechanical, aerospace and nuclear engineering. “But unless 
        60% of people are fully vaccinated, the interventions should not be reduced very quickly, 
        especially face-mask wearing. If the interventions are reduced very quickly, it could induce 
        another surge.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Control theory establishes the relationship between the inputs and outputs of a system. 
        The movement of a car, for example, can be predicted based on inputs to the steering wheel, 
        gas, and brake.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mapping the inputs in a social system is not a simple matter, but the team hypothesized that 
        levels of vaccination and NPIs could serve as the inputs. The team modified the existing 
        Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Deceased model, which is used by epidemiologists to predict 
        the spread of disease, using real-world data on vaccination rates, NPIs, and the number of 
        people infected, recovered, and killed by COVID-19 in each community.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The SIRD model captures the spread of disease. But we want to know, how do you control that 
        spread?” said Diagne. “What we do is to build a feedback loop, where we design the input signals 
        and fine-tune impacts of those inputs so that the output exactly matches the number of infections, 
        deaths, and recoveries happening in the U.S. And with that, we can change the inputs, relaxing the 
        interventions, and predicting how it will affect the disease.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Diagne, Gao, and Zhong were joined in the research on “Vaccination and three non-pharmaceutical 
        interventions determine the end of COVID-19 at 381 metropolitan statistical areas in the US” by 
        Qi Wang at Northeastern University.

    <h2>Will Next Generation of Exascale Supercomputers Be Able To Work With Petascale Data?</h2>
    <img src="news4.JPG" alt="News4" width="350" height="250">
    <p>
        The next generations of supercomputers will be powerful enough to analyze complex interactions, 
        like those between the users of a social network or between the neurons in a human brain. But 
        the match between a machine that works on the exascale (1018 operations per second) and a 
        complex dataset on the petascale (1015 elements) presents multiple challenges and must be 
        carefully orchestrated.
    </p>
    <p>
        George Slota, a computer scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, has been granted a 
        prestigious National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award to 
        develop approaches to the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        “How do we best understand and get insight from this kind of data? To do that, we have to map 
        the data to the hardware, with consideration of the algorithm itself,” said Slota, who has been 
        awarded a $490,000 grant. “Each aspect is fairly challenging because of the complexity of the 
        data and the complexity of modern hardware.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine a social network as large as Twitter or Facebook. In the world of data, each user can be 
        described as a point or “node,” and each interaction between users is a line or “edge” between 
        the nodes. There are nearly limitless attributes for a node – geographical location, age, 
        favorite tree – and the number of edges that connect users are apt to be highly irregular 
        given that some people have millions of connections and other just a handful. The collection 
        of nodes and edges, called “graph structured data,” presents two problems to computer scientists 
        in that the data set can be both massive and irregular. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “There isn’t any inherent kind of pattern or structure to a lot of these networks,” 
        Slota said. “So it becomes computationally challenging to work with these data sets 
        because you can’t make any assumptions about what’s going on under the hood without 
        actually first studying what’s going on under the hood.”
    </p>
    <p>
        With the grant, Slota will develop a “graph layout,” a high-quality and scalable means of 
        partitioning, ordering, and storing the data given the data type, the relevant algorithms,
        and the hardware platform that will be used to analyze it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the data is loaded in a way that makes sense, the second challenge is processing it. 
        In many ways, these are similar problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Slota will work to map the data and the algorithmic analysis method to the equally complex and 
        irregular architecture of the supercomputer, with its network of interconnected computers, 
        processors, and multiple levels of memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then, Slota said, “we want to bring it home,” by which he means producing scalable 
        open-source software, software frameworks, and toolkits that will enable the broader 
        scientific community to easily address these challenges as related to their specific dataset, 
        analytical problem, and hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The ideal solution is a general purpose way that, given any arbitrary dataset, we can load it, 
        process it, and solve some arbitrary problem that’s relevant to a biologist who’s studying the 
        brain, or a physicist studying particle interactions, or whatever the application may be,” 
        Slota said.
    </p>
    <p>
        “A key challenge pacing data-driven scientific advancement is the ability to organize and 
        extract meaning from massive datasets associated with many fields of present-day research. 
        George’s work points the way towards new solutions to this critical data analysis bottleneck.  
        This CAREER award recognizes his potential, as well as the importance of this research, and we 
        congratulate him on this recognition,” said Curt Breneman, dean of the School of Science.

    <h2>App Developed at Rensselaer Can Help Guide COVID-19 Management on Any Campus</h2>
    <img src="news5.JPG" alt="News5" width="350" height="250">
    <p>
        In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as leaders at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
        prepared to bring students back to campus for the fall 2020 semester, they relied on a 
        powerful algorithm to determine that twice-weekly testing of all students would be the 
        optimal regimen for keeping the infection rate on campus safely below 1% for any two-week 
        period. With less than two weeks remaining in the in-person portion of the semester and an 
        overall infection rate well below 0.5% for the entire semester, the approach has proven 
        effective.
    </p>
    <p>
        That algorithm, developed by Rensselaer computer science professor Malik Magdon-Ismail, 
        is now publicly available as COVID Back-to-School, a free online app built and maintained 
        by the Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Consistent with our legacy of technological expertise, Rensselaer was able to develop a 
        number of tools and strategies in-house that have enabled us to maintain control over the 
        virus and remain focused on our education and research mission this semester,” said Rensselaer 
        President Shirley Ann Jackson. “We encourage other institutions to learn from and use these 
        tools, like COVID Back-to-School, in hopes that they have similar success in the spring.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Working with Magdon-Ismail, the app was constructed by a team of undergraduate and graduate 
        researchers overseen by Kristin Bennett, the associate director of IDEA and a professor of 
        mathematics at Rensselaer, and John Erickson, the director of operations for IDEA, and 
        supported by the United Health Foundation. It is one of six COVID-related projects underway 
        in the Data INCITE Lab within IDEA.
    </p>
    <p>
        Based on information provided about a specific school and its intended approach to 
        managing the virus, COVID Back-to-School can project outcomes such as the proportion of 
        students infected over time and the number of likely new infections every 14 days. Users can 
        explore how changing the testing frequency affects the number of anticipated infections, as 
        well as how a party or gathering — depending on its size and duration, and whether or not 
        attendees are wearing masks — might impact the number of positive cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app can be used by decision-makers on a range of campuses, from elementary school to college.
    </p>
    <p>
        “This is a publicly available tool that we’re hoping schools can use to quantitatively 
        analyze re-opening strategies,” Magdon-Ismail said. “Schools can use it, at least, to 
        evaluate how their current strategy will play out assuming an infection on campus. Better 
        still, COVID Back-to-School allows schools to try out various strategies before actually 
        implementing them, to see what works and what doesn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Magdon-Ismail built COVID Back-to-School after developing COVID War Room, another a publicly 
        available app he developed to help leaders of smaller cities and counties understand how 
        COVID-19 would spread in their less densely populated areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        COVID Back-to-School and COVID War Room rely on so-called “robust” machine learning algorithms 
        that can offer accurate predictions despite the sparse, less frequently updated, data generated 
        by smaller populations. The COVID War Room app offers local information on aspects of the 
        pandemic — such as the rate of infections over time, the rate at which mild infections become 
        serious, and estimates for asymptomatic infections — for all 50 states by county and for 
        numerous international locations.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are just two of many powerful tools developed and implemented at Rensselaer as part of a 
        comprehensive virus mitigation strategy, known as T3SQI — Testing, Tracing, Tracking, 
        Surveillance, and Quarantine/Isolation. For example, Rensselaer staff developed a rapid, 
        contactless automated process for testing check-in, which made it possible to maintain a 
        rate of 7,000 tests per week. The majority of tests conducted on campus were processed in 
        Rensselaer labs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to regular testing, campus community members entered information about their 
        health and activities each day via apps developed at Rensselaer, which enable rapid and 
        effective contact tracing. Additionally, a team of Rensselaer faculty and staff monitored 
        wireless network congestion data to identify areas and times where adjustments were needed 
        to reduce the population density. Informed by Magdon-Ismail’s modeling, Rensselaer also 
        reduced the density of in-person classes, staggered student meal times, and required masks for 
        everyone on campus, among other measures to combat the spread of the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Rensselaer is a community of doers committed to changing the world, so it is no surprise 
        that when faced with a novel challenge, we have risen to the occasion,” President Jackson said. 
        “I am confident that the work of our experts, like Professor Magdon-Ismail and many others, 
        will benefit countless campus communities, in addition to our own, as we find our way through 
        this difficult time.”
