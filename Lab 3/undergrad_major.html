<h2>Undergraduate Major</h2>
<div class="coursework"> 
    <h3>B.S. in Information Technology and Web Science</h3>      
    <p>
        In a world in which information technology affects virtually everything we do, 
        there is a demand for an academic program that offers students the deepest understanding of 
        the Web.  As an ITWS student, you will investigate issues related to security, trust, privacy, 
        content value, and the development of the Web in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will take a core set of courses on Web and IT development and management, along with 
        courses in your concentration, selected from more than 20 options, including arts, engineering, 
        management, communications, artificial intelligence, Web systems, and medicine.
    </p>

        area. Concentration options include arts, communication and networks, law, management 
        information systems, medicine, psychology, and numerous others. In consultation with a faculty 
        adviser, students may also design their own concentration through the selection of courses that 
        match their individual interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Along with the 8 required courses (32 credits) for your concentration, you must take the

    <h4>ARCH</h4>
    <p>
        The Arch is a unique approach to education that provides flexibility in the semester schedule, 
        allowing students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare 
        them to meet the multifaceted challenges of the 21st century. The Arch is a requirement of the 
        Rensselaer curriculum.
    </p>
    <p>
        Summer Here: During The Arch, students remain on campus for the summer after their sophomore 
        year, taking junior-level classes, and receive focused attention from professors at this pivotal 
        point in their academic progression. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The World Away: Then, students leave the Troy campus for a semester during the traditional 
        junior year—either fall or spring—to pursue their passions in the form of co-ops, internships, 
        civic engagement, research, or international experiences. Students who pursue these 
        opportunities during their academic career are better prepared for future professional 
        careers and graduate school.
